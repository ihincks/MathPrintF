Copy init.m to 

$MATHPATH/Applications/MathPrintF/

and load it by running

<<MathPrintF`

To autoload it on the start of the kernel, copy init.m to

$MATHPATH/Autoload/MathPrintF

The actual location of $MATHPATH will depend on your system. You can determine it
by looking at the $Path variable inside Mathematica. Here are some paths for common
operating systems:

OS-X:                ~/Library/Mathematica/
Linux (Debian):      ~/.Mathematica/
Windows:             %APPDATA%\Mathematica\
