To install as an add-on copy the MathPrintF directory to 
~/Library/Mathematica/Applications/. To use it, run <<MathPrintF` before calling
the printf[] functions.

Alternatively add to ~/Library/Mathematica/Autoload/
The package will be autoloaded and you can use printf[] functions without any
additional code.

The above only works on OS-X. You'll have to figure out where the relevant
directories are on your system. A good place to start is to look at the $Path
variable in Mathematica.

I did not have a ~/Library/Autoload or ~/Library/Applications on my Linux 
install.  To install I soft linked the directory using the following command:

    sudo ln -s "PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_init.m" /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/AddOns/Packages/MathPrintF
    
Also noticed that the directory name and the package name in init.m must match.
