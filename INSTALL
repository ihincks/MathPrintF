To install as an add-on copy the MathPrintF directory to ~/Library/Applications.
To use it, simply do <<MathPrintF` before calling the printf[] functions.

Alternatively add to ~/Library/Autoload/
The package will be autoloaded and you can use printf[] functions without any
additional code.

The above only works on OS-X. You'll have to figure out where the relevant
directories are on your system. A good place to start is to look at the $Path
variable in Mathematica.
