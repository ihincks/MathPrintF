Limited Functionality
------------------------
While I am working on adding functionality to mimic the C-standard as much
as possible, only certain features are implemented. These are mainly dictated
by what I need the most. In particular %d and %f with most of their options
are implemented. If a particular feature is missing please let me know at
vloodo@yahoo.co.uk and I will do my best to implement it as quickly as possible.
